read the @standards-ingest-prd.md and understand the whole of its context. We want to implement section "6.4 Standards Sets Management". Do not implement any other parts of the requirements yet. 

This is a new feature being added to the existing application. So review and consider the current codebase. Follow the same approach and conventions already implemented. For example look at @controller.js @index.njk @router.js. Follow GDS patterns. 

Come up with a plan before implementing. Think it through step by step.
